# ACP session lifecycle implementation

This work implements the reviewed SandDance requirement
`docs/dune-acp-session-lifecycle-requirements.md` (55 acceptance cases), against
Dune baseline `bd17acc`. The requirement describes the target, not capabilities
already shipped. Implementation uses tracer bullets: each slice must establish
an observable contract and its verification before the next slice expands it.

## Slices

1. Public submission identity, admission observations, and a persistent registry
   with atomic key ownership. Prove that a read cannot reject a late request,
   duplicate keys cannot acquire execution twice, and ownership survives reopen.
2. Caller-owned submission IDs through SDK, host, Gateway, and fabricd. Prove
   receipt lookup after an interrupted response over the public network route.
3. A tmux-hosted ACP process and private IPC. Move the existing controller into
   that process and preserve one real Agent across connector restart.
4. Managed queue, model, permission, and operation continuity; controller fencing
   and bounded control reservations. Exercise concurrent clients and faults.
5. Raw ACP complete-message admission, ordered writes, bounded output resumption,
   and permanent input failure after an unrecoverable partial write.
6. Discovery availability, independent forget admission and cleanup recovery,
   deadlines, budgets, and all public consumers.
7. Upgrade preflight, pinned dependencies, release artifacts, platform and real
   Agent acceptance, and SandDance public-boundary integration.

Each completed slice is committed separately; a slice may require several
commits. A passing unit test is not evidence of process survival. L01–L55 remain
unverified until the corresponding execution evidence is recorded below.

## Decisions

- Transport request IDs and connection epochs do not identify business submits.
  Callers create `submission_id` before their first send.
- Launch keys bind an owner and complete Runner binding; Runtime keys also bind
  the original Runtime incarnation and generation. Forget shares that namespace.
- A durable key claim only prevents competing execution. It is not an admission
  receipt. Queries of an uncommitted claim remain `unknown`.
- Keep the existing ACP protocol/model implementation. Explicit new/load retains
  its process replacement and old-callback isolation independently of IPC reconnect.
- Persist minimum identity and admission evidence, not Agent prompts or secrets.
- Ordinary capacity cannot consume stop, cancel, permission, or cleanup reserves.

## Verification record

Initial environment: macOS arm64, Go 1.27.1, bundled `bin/tmux` and protobuf tools
available. `DUNE_REAL_AGENT`, `DUNE_TEST_POSTGRES`, and `DUNE_NATIVE_CODEX_HOME`
were not configured. No business Runner has been restarted.

Slice 1 foundation: `go test -race ./pkg/api ./internal/sessionregistry -count=1
-timeout=90s` passes. Tests cover caller key validation and error preservation,
read-before-admission, uncommitted claims after reopen, irreversible rejection,
scope isolation, cross-receiver conflicts, concurrent SQLite connections, three
real processes claiming one key, and unsafe registry paths. Test directories are
explicitly made private; the implementation does not relax its 0700 requirement.

The registry currently provides bounded minimum evidence and exclusive claims.
It is not yet connected to public execution, and protected control reservations,
safe evidence reclamation, host IPC, and lifecycle cleanup are subsequent slices.
These foundation tests do not mark any L01–L55 end-to-end case passed.

Slice 2 read path: `Client.QuerySubmission` follows SDK → Gateway → fabricd →
the independent registry. It validates the caller's complete key, preserves that
key and context/structured errors, bypasses transport response caching, and does
not require an active Runtime. Hosted access checks owner, complete binding and
outer Runtime selectors before permitting the read.

`go test ./tests -run '^TestSubmissionQueryAcrossFabricdRestart$' -count=1
-timeout=90s -v` passes with a real Gateway and replacement fabricd process after
SIGKILL. The test seeds admission evidence directly in the registry, then proves
the public read returns the same receipt after restart without creating an Agent.
This is a receipt-read tracer bullet, not Agent survival or public write admission.

Targeted race checks for QuerySubmission, submission authorization, and the
engine state lock pass. `go vet ./pkg/api ./internal/sessionregistry ./pkg/client
./pkg/access ./pkg/fabricd` passes.
The full `go test -race ./pkg/client ./pkg/access ./pkg/fabricd -count=1
-timeout=180s` also passes (including existing authorization, ACP and PTY tests).

Slice 2 write path: `Client.Submit` carries a caller-owned Runtime key through
Gateway authorization to the existing ACP queue. The queue persists admission
before dispatch, including two keys sharing an in-flight load operation. Exact
duplicates return the original operation, changed requests conflict, and durable
validation rejection returns `not_accepted` with its original structured code.
SDK errors retain the original key and any validated admission receipt.

`go test -race ./pkg/api ./pkg/client ./pkg/fabricd ./pkg/access -count=1
-timeout=180s` passes. `go test ./tests -run
'^Test(ManagedSubmissionAdmissionThroughGateway|SubmissionQueryAcrossFabricdRestart)$'
-count=1 -timeout=100s -v` passes. The mock RPC log contains exactly one new and
one prompt after duplicate and rejected submissions. Unit coverage verifies
shared loads and that failed admission persistence dispatches no Agent RPC.

The feature branch still has the old consumer entry points pending migration;
this is an intermediate slice, not a compatibility commitment. Agent lifetime
is still owned by fabricd at this point. Protected controls, launch admission,
independent host ownership, and L01–L55 process acceptance remain outstanding.

Slice 3 process tracer bullet: managed ACP now runs inside `_acp_host`, hosted
by a separate private tmux server under the installation's `acp` directory.
The host reuses the original controller, queue, model, operations and process
guardian. The connector stores only an IPC proxy. Agent argv/environment use
a private bootstrap file removed by the host; tmux receives no protocol data.
The Agent has anonymous stdin/stdout pipes and separately consumed stderr.

Private Yamux IPC validates installation, machine, host instance and full Runtime
identity. A persistent connector control term fences older connectors; takeover
is serialized with business admission. Read-only handshakes do not take control.
Engine.Close closes proxies while leaving independent hosts alive. Discovery
reopens the original endpoint without initialize/new/load. Unreachable proxies
keep their last lifecycle description with `availability: unavailable`.

`go test -race ./pkg/access ./pkg/fabricd -count=1 -timeout=180s` passes.
`go test ./pkg/host ./tests -run
'Test(ACPConversation|ManagedACPOriginal|ManagedSubmission)' -count=1
-timeout=180s` passes (pkg/host had no matching tests).
`TestManagedACPOriginalProcessAcrossConnectorRestart` uses real tmux, Gateway,
host, Agent and replacement fabricd processes. After SIGKILL, blocked and queued
prompts finish while fabricd is absent; their original receipts and operations
remain readable. A subsequent SIGTERM/restart preserves the same permission and
model. A single Agent process log confirms genuine pipes and no extra
initialize/new/load. Existing explicit load/generation barrier tests pass.
`TestSessionHostControlFencesOlderConnectorsAndProbesAreReadOnly` and private-file
checks pass under race detection. Client/tmux race checks also pass.

Still pending: raw ACP ownership, independent launch/forget admission (the
existing forget execution is only routed cleanup at this slice), shared machine
quotas, protected control evidence, complete discovery diagnostics, fixed binary
dependencies, service-manager/platform tests and public consumer contract migration.
No full L01–L55 completion claim is made by this process tracer bullet.
